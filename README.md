# Phoenix Deployment with Distillery

This is a sample Phoenix application that you can use as a starting point for your own
Phoenix project on [Render](https://render.com).


This setup uses [Distillery](https://hexdocs.pm/distillery/home.html) to package the app for deployment.

The sample app, derived from [Phoenix's Up And Running Tutorial](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/up_and_running.html) is deployed at [https://phoenix-distillery.onrender.com](https://phoenix-distillery.onrender.com).
